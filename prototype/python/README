In the development of CoinShuffle we have modified the code of Dissent,
available at http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/ccs10/.
Dissent code has been developed by:
Henry Corrigan-Gibbs (henry.corrigan-gibbs @ yale.edu)
Bryan Ford (bryan.ford @ yale.edu)

In Coinshuffle implementation we only modify shuffle_node.py and anon_crypto.py
files.
The rest of sources files have been kept unchanged.

In the following, we replay the instructions available at Dissent code.
They must be followed to run CoinShuffle.

...                 ...
... I. Introduction ...
...                 ...

This is a Python prototype of Dissent, a new protocol for
anonymous message exchange between a small-to-medium sized
group of nodes (10s or 100s).

For a technical description of the protocol, please see:
http://arxiv4.library.cornell.edu/abs/1004.3057

We are releasing this prototype under the GNU General Public
License (GPL), version 3; see the file COPYING for details.
If you would like to use this code in a way that makes this
choice of open source licenses a problem, contact us.



...                ...
... II. Disclaimer ...
...                ...

THIS IS NOT A SECURE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DISSENT PROTOCOL.
DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE TO TRANSMIT SECRET OR SENSITIVE DATA.

This implementation contains some obvious security holes:
-- It does not use a public-key infrastructure.  Nodes exchange
   public keys by sending them across open channels.
-- It does not implement any of the "blame" portions of the
   protocol, so it's not accountable yet.

There are also some less obvious security holes:
-- Nodes take different amounts of time in certain parts of the
   protocol depending on the length of the message they want to
   send.  A real implementation would need a method of avoiding
   timing attacks.
-- ...and many others.



...                   ...
... III. Installation ...
...                   ...


Every node must be running:
-- Python 2.6 (or better)
-- M2Crypto 0.20.2
    Available at: http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto
-- pyelliptic
    Available at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyelliptic
-- GNU time (to measure the time of the execution)


For our tests we used Ubuntu 7.04.

We note that installing M2Crypto can be a big pain.  If you
plan to run this implementation on Emulab, we have a pre-made
OS image called UbuntuAnon with these components pre-installed.
Contact us and we can probably get it to you.

Configuration-specific instructions follow:

LOCAL MACHINE
	0) Unpack the install archive into a directory.
	1) Edit the settings.py file to reflect your system config.
	2) Run main.py with the -l flag any other options (below).

EMULAB TESTBED
	0) Edit the file misc/emulab.ns to reflect the number of
	   Emulab nodes on which you want to run the protocol.
	1) Get an Emulab account (www.emulab.net) and create a new
	   experiment.  Use the file misc/emulab.ns as your network
	   simulation file.
	2) Append your public SSH public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	   so that you don't have to type your password in to login
	   to each node.
	3) Unpack the install archive into a directory on your local
	   (control) machine.
	4) Unpack the archive into a directory on an Emulab node.
	5) Edit the settings.py file, adding your Emulab username,
	   Emulab network address, and the directory where you unpacked
	   the archive.
	6) Run main.py with the -e flag any other options (below).

LOCAL LAN
	Running the simulator on your local LAN will be similar to
	running on Emulab.  In the settings.py file, just set the Emulab
	suffix to your local LAN network name.

...         ...
... IV. Use ...
...         ...

ADDRESS FILE
	You must create a an address file contaning the addresses of the
	nodes you want to use in your simulation.  Address files have one
	line per node, no comments, and no blank spaces between lines.

	The format of each line is:
	NODE_NAME NODE_PORT

	If you're running locally, NODE_NAME will be localhost for every line
	and NODE_PORT should be some high port number that's different for every
	line (e.g. 50001, 50002, ...).

	If you're running on Emulab, NODE_NAME will be the name of the remote
	host in your Emulab network (WITHOUT the network name).  If you used
	our pre-made .ns file, NODE_NAME will be node-1, node-2, ...
	NODE_PORTs for Emulab can be any high port (e.g. 50000) and can be
	the same for all nodes.

SWITCHES
	If you run:

	$ python main.py

	you will get a description of the command-line switches.  All are required.

EXAMPLES
	Running Dissent locally with 5 nodes.  We run the shuffle protocol only
	and distribute 1048576 bytes of data (1MB) equally across all nodes.
	The addresses of these nodes is in addr/local.txt (relative to main.py).

	$ python main.py -l -s 1048576 each 5 addr/local.txt

	Running Dissent on Emulab with 40 nodes.  We run both the shuffle and bulk
	protocols and give 1048576 bytes of data (1MB) to one random node, giving
	all other nodes 128 bytes of data.  The addresses of these nodes is in
	addr/emu.txt (relative to main.py).

	$ python main.py -e -b 1048576 one 40 addr/emu.txt

MISC
	The scripts killall.py and ekillall.py might be useful for stopping
	run-away processes on remote nodes.
